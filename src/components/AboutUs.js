			<h1>Our History</h1>
			<p>Trippy's About Us page puts its mission statement front and center. This approach can work well for a mission-driven brand that’s working toward a goal its audience can get behind.

Much like 4ocean, consider splitting your About Us page into specific subpages and showcase your value proposition. </p>
